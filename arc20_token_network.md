ARC20: Redefining Decentralized AI Development 

In the coming months we will be transforming blockchain and AI integration with our token standard ARC20, a game changing step forward towards our vision of democratizing #GenAI. ARC20 will be the backbone of an open, decentralized ecosystem where building groundbreaking AI applications will be built by developers that share our vision.

Why ARC20?

ARC20 tokens will serve as the foundation for any app, website, or front-ends that harness our powerful AI text and image generation network. This framework empowers developers to create cutting edge and AI driven products while directly benefiting from the robust token economy that we are currently building.

Developer Incentives

Similar to how our emissions model will incentivize AI workers running our generative network, ARC20  tokens will reward developers with tokenized ownership of their apps. This alignment of economic incentives fuels innovation, ensuring developers benefit directly from the value they create.

Open DEX Framework

The ARC20 standard also enables a truly open decentralized exchange ecosystem, where each token trades independently, representing the intrinsic value of its associated AI-powered project. Developers can seamlessly build and operate DEXs tailored to their needs and AIPG will initially run a DEX where Grid tokens will be traded.

The Vision

By combining blockchain’s transparency with AI’s transformative power, we’re creating an ecosystem where developers, AI workers, and end-users collaborate in a mutually beneficial cycle of innovation and reward.

This will be more than just a token standard—it’s going to be foundation for a new era of decentralized, AI-powered applications.
