Max Supply: 150 Million AIPG
Block Reward: 15.625 AIPG

AIPG is currently in the second phase of the emissions schedule. This intermediate emissions period is hallmarked by a lower block rewards and increased deflation. The total supply at the end of the Intermediate halvenings will equal 95% of the maximum supply. Below is a summary of the Second Phase and the intermediate halvenings.

Approx. Dates: NOV 21, 2024 to AUG 23, 2029

Block Height: 500,000 to 3,000,000

Block Reward: 15.625 AIPG

Total Supply by end of Second Phase: 140 million AIPG

% of Max Supply: 87.5%

Four Intermediate Halvenings

Approx. Dates: AUG 23, 2029 to AUG 20, 2033

Block Height: 3,000,000 to 5,100,000

New Block Reward: 1st – 7.81, 2nd – 3.91, 3rd – 1.95, and 4th – 0.98

Total Supply by end of last Intermediate Halvening: 145 million AIPG

% of Max Supply: 95%

Third Phase
The Third Phase maintains the block reward of the last Intermediate Halvening event and lasts 3,750,000 blocks or approximately 7 years. The period of halvening after the Third Phase is referred to as the Mature Halvening and lasts 1,050,000 blocks each or approximately

2 years each. Mature Halvening starts the 9th halvening event; however, there is no end halvening due to how halvening works. Please read the ‘Maximum Supply’ section below to understand more about how halvenings work.

Approx. Dates: AUG 20, 2033 to OCT 6, 2040

Block Height: 5,100,000 to 8,850,000

Block Reward: 0.98 AIPG

Total Supply by end of Third Phase: 148 million AIPG

% of Max Supply: 98.9%

Mature Halvenings

Approx. Starting Date: OCT 6, 2040 Starting Block Height: 8,850,000 Starting Block Reward: 0.48 AIPG

Total Supply by end of the Mature Halvening: ~150 million AIPG

% of Max Supply: ~100%

The maximum supply is 150 million AIPG; however, it will never fully reach 150 million. In cryptocurrency systems that implement a halving mechanism, the block reward that miners or validators receive for adding new transactions to the blockchain is reduced by half at regular intervals. This reduction continues at each halving event, exponentially decreasing the number of new coins created.

With each halving, the number of new coins minted will decrease geometrically. As this process continues, the rewards become so small that they effectively approach zero, but never actually reach it. This is like the concept of Zeno's paradox, where you can always go half the distance to a target but never quite reach it.

For example, if we start with a block reward of 50 coins:

After the 1st halving, the new reward is 25 coins.

After the 2nd halving, it's 12.5 coins.

This pattern continues indefinitely.

With each halving, you make progress toward the total supply but with diminishing returns. As a result, you add fewer and fewer coins with each passing event, and thus, in practice, it would take an infinite amount of time to actually reach the total supply cap.

The exact point at which you get asymptotically close to the total supply depends on the specifics of the emission schedule and the intervals between halvenings. In an implementation like this, the theoretical cap of 150 million serves more as a ceiling that the supply can approach but never quite touch, ensuring scarcity and potentially increasing the coin's value over time due to this diminishing emission.
